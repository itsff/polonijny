I'd like it to also provide the ability of just using a simple, hierarchical JSON file. DAL should provide for read/write capability and be thread safe. Website doesn't get that much traffic anyway. Also make an application for converting Mongo-style JSON to a simple JSON array of objects.","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-22T01:11:31.921876231-06:00","updated_at":"2026-02-22T01:23:14.565837852-06:00"}
